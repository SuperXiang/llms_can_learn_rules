  Question: In base-10, what is 76 + 14?
  Answer:
  76 is 7, 6. 14 is 1, 4. So the steps are 6 + 4, 7 + 1.
  There is no carry. 6 + 4 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 0.
  The carry is 1. 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. 9 is 0, 9. So we clear the carry. Prepend 9 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 9, 0.
  There is no carry. So far the answer has 2 digits: 9, 0.
  Therefore, the answer is 90.

  Question: In base-10, what is 97 + 74?
  Answer:
  97 is 9, 7. 74 is 7, 4. So the steps are 7 + 4, 9 + 7.
  There is no carry. 7 + 4 = 11. 11 is 1, 1. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 1.
  The carry is 1. 9 + 7 + 1 = 17. 17 is 1, 7. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 7 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 7, 1.
  The carry is 1. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 7, 1.
  Therefore, the answer is 171.

  Question: In base-10, what is 85 + 48?
  Answer:
  85 is 8, 5. 48 is 4, 8. So the steps are 5 + 8, 8 + 4.
  There is no carry. 5 + 8 = 13. 13 is 1, 3. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 3 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 3.
  The carry is 1. 8 + 4 + 1 = 13. 13 is 1, 3. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 3 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 3, 3.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 3, 3.
  Therefore, the answer is 133.

  Question: In base-10, what is 34 + 31?
  Answer:
  34 is 3, 4. 31 is 3, 1. So the steps are 4 + 1, 3 + 3.
  There is no carry. 4 + 1 = 5. 5 is 0, 5. So we clear the carry. Prepend 5 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 5.
  There is no carry. 3 + 3 = 6. 6 is 0, 6. So we clear the carry. Prepend 6 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 6, 5.
  There is no carry. So far the answer has 2 digits: 6, 5.
  Therefore, the answer is 65.

  Question: In base-10, what is 58 + 34?
  Answer:
  58 is 5, 8. 34 is 3, 4. So the steps are 8 + 4, 5 + 3.
  There is no carry. 8 + 4 = 12. 12 is 1, 2. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 2 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 2.
  The carry is 1. 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. 9 is 0, 9. So we clear the carry. Prepend 9 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 9, 2.
  There is no carry. So far the answer has 2 digits: 9, 2.
  Therefore, the answer is 92.
