  Question: In base-11, what is 76 + 14?
  Answer:
  76 is 7, 6. 14 is 1, 4. So the steps are 6 + 4, 7 + 1.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><6><4>6 + 4 = A. A is 0, A. So we clear the carry. Prepend A to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: A.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><7><1>7 + 1 = 8. 8 is 0, 8. So we clear the carry. Prepend 8 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 8, A.
  There is no carry. So far the answer has 2 digits: 8, A.
  Therefore, the answer is 8A.

  Question: In base-11, what is 97 + 74?
  Answer:
  97 is 9, 7. 74 is 7, 4. So the steps are 7 + 4, 9 + 7.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><7><4>7 + 4 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 0.
  The carry is 1. <carry><9><7>9 + 7 + 1 = 16. 16 is 1, 6. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 6 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 6, 0.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 6, 0.
  Therefore, the answer is 160.

  Question: In base-11, what is 85 + A3?
  Answer:
  85 is 8, 5. A3 is A, 3. So the steps are 5 + 3, 8 + A.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><5><3>5 + 3 = 8. 8 is 0, 8. So we clear the carry. Prepend 8 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 8.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><8><A>8 + A = 17. 17 is 1, 7. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 7 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 7, 8.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 7, 8.
  Therefore, the answer is 178.

  Question: In base-11, what is 92 + 52?
  Answer:
  92 is 9, 2. 52 is 5, 2. So the steps are 2 + 2, 9 + 5.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><2><2>2 + 2 = 4. 4 is 0, 4. So we clear the carry. Prepend 4 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 4.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><9><5>9 + 5 = 13. 13 is 1, 3. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 3 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 3, 4.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 3, 4.
  Therefore, the answer is 134.

  Question: In base-11, what is 29 + 58?
  Answer:
  29 is 2, 9. 58 is 5, 8. So the steps are 9 + 8, 2 + 5.
  There is no carry. <no_carry><9><8>9 + 8 = 16. 16 is 1, 6. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 6 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 6.
  The carry is 1. <carry><2><5>2 + 5 + 1 = 8. 8 is 0, 8. So we clear the carry. Prepend 8 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 8, 6.
  There is no carry. So far the answer has 2 digits: 8, 6.
  Therefore, the answer is 86.
