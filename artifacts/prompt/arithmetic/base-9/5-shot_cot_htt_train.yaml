  Question: In base-9, what is 76 + 14?
  Answer:
  76 is 7, 6. 14 is 1, 4. So the steps are 6 + 4, 7 + 1.
  There is no carry. 6 + 4 = 11. 11 is 1, 1. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 1.
  The carry is 1. 7 + 1 + 1 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 0, 1.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 0, 1.
  Therefore, the answer is 101.

  Question: In base-9, what is 86 + 57?
  Answer:
  86 is 8, 6. 57 is 5, 7. So the steps are 6 + 7, 8 + 5.
  There is no carry. 6 + 7 = 14. 14 is 1, 4. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 4 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 4.
  The carry is 1. 8 + 5 + 1 = 15. 15 is 1, 5. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 5 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 5, 4.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 5, 4.
  Therefore, the answer is 154.

  Question: In base-9, what is 63 + 34?
  Answer:
  63 is 6, 3. 34 is 3, 4. So the steps are 3 + 4, 6 + 3.
  There is no carry. 4 + 3 = 7. 7 is 0, 7. So we clear the carry. Prepend 7 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 7.
  There is no carry. 6 + 3 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 0, 7.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 0, 7.
  Therefore, the answer is 107.

  Question: In base-9, what is 31 + 58?
  Answer:
  31 is 3, 1. 58 is 5, 8. So the steps are 1 + 8, 3 + 5.
  There is no carry. 1 + 8 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 0.
  The carry is 1. 3 + 5 + 1 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 0, 0.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 0, 0.
  Therefore, the answer is 100.

  Question: In base-9, what is 67 + 25?
  Answer:
  67 is 6, 7. 25 is 2, 5. So the steps are 7 + 5, 6 + 2.
  There is no carry. 7 + 5 = 13. 13 is 1, 3. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 3 to the answer. So far the answer has 1 digit: 3.
  The carry is 1. 6 + 2 + 1 = 10. 10 is 1, 0. So we set the carry to 1. Prepend 0 to the answer. So far the answer has 2 digits: 0, 3.
  The carry is 1. Prepend 1 to the answer. So far the answer has 3 digits: 1, 0, 3.
  Therefore, the answer is 103.
